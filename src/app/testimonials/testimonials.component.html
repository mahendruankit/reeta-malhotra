      110 out of 100! Yes, that’s the score. You must be wondering what this
      score means and how it’s even possible. Let me explain: this is the score
      I would like to give to Reeta Malhotra, ma'am, for the writing analysis
      she conducted a couple of days ago. When I submitted my writing for
      analysis, she asked me if I had pain in my ankles. My answer was no, but
      two weeks later, the pain started, and I could relate it to her
      prediction. When she began explaining my qualities and areas for
      improvement, I couldn’t believe how spot on she was. Just like an
      astrologer reveals insights about your past, present, and future, she made
      predictions that were incredibly accurate. This not only surprised me but
      also sparked my curiosity about this subject and my desire to learn more.
      Thank you for the analysis and motivational counseling. I hope this
      knowledge benefits more and more people. Thank you once again.

      I was surprised to learn that handwriting can also communicate. I didn’t
      realize that handwriting has the power of communication until I discovered
      many truths about myself thanks to Reeta Malhotra. She possesses the skill
      to uncover what we hide within ourselves by analyzing our handwriting. The
      handwriting analysis highlighted various aspects of my personality, and
      all the points were accurate. I would give an overall score of 96 out of
      100 for the analysis.

      handwriting analysis. I am excited to begin my graphotherapy journey with
      her. Her analysis and readings were remarkably accurate, and I was able to
      relate to each and every point. Her insights have compelled me to make
      significant changes in my life. I’m eager to embark on this journey under
      her guidance.
